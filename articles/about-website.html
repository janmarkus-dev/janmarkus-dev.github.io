<h1>About this website</h1>
<p>A rough overview of the design, philosophy, implications and future of this website</p>

<h3>First there was "Why?"</h3>
<p>Well, I need a website. I need it to share my projects, transparency, to learn networking, html and css and to share scripts to my future videos. Yes, scripts. I will always first write a script, mostly in the form of an article, and then simply record a video for the important ones.</p>
<h3>Technology behind the site</h3>
<p>I like the web of yesteryear. I also happened to like modern design, notabily google's material you. These are things which usually don't mix so I'm on my own. The main rule while making this was no javascript, php, or any other scripting language. I'm sticking to HTML and CSS. For now I will be making the website desktop centric, however I will, in the background, be working on a entirely separate stylesheet for mobile and tablet interfaces, which will keep the content the same, however will optimize typography and scaling for small screens and/or vertical screens.</p>
<h3>The one to host them all</h3>
<p>The website is currently obviously hosted on github pages. This is because its te simplest way to host a static html site online for free. Once I get a few things together, and gain more knowledge about webhosting, I will host the website on a raspberrypi.</p>
