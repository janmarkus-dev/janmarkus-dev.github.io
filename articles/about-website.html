<h1>About this website</h1>
<p>A rough overview of the design, philosophy, implications and future of this website</p>
</header>

<h3>First there was "Why?"</h3>
<p>Well, I need a website. I need it to share my projects, transparency, to learn webdev, and to share my opinions. I will always first write an article, publish it here, and then record a video for ones that I find crucial. These videos will (as well as the articles) go into public domain and will be published on the website. I believe everyone should have access to information, and to make this a reality, I will publish everything I find interesting onto here.</p>
<h3>Technology behind the site</h3>
<p>I like the web of the yesteryear. I also happened to like modern design, notabily google's material you. These are things which usually don't mix so finding a good balance was (and still is) a tricky task. The main rule while making this was no javascript, php, or any other scripting language. I'm going with just pure HTML and CSS. For now I will be making the website desktop centric, however I am actively working on a smaller screen stylesheet to improve the accessibility of the website.</p>
<h3>The one to host them all</h3>
<p>The website is currently hosted on Github pages. This is because its the simplest way to host a static html site online for free. Once I get a few things together, and gain more knowledge about webhosting, I will host the website on a raspberrypi. As always, I prefer something where the user is actually in control. I will never use a proprietary solution which will keep me, and the users in the passanger seat.</p>
<h3>About personal goals, and the footer</h3>
<p>I don't really like AI. I believe AGI (which stands for Artificial General Intelligence) will be the final nail in the coffin of the human race. I do however understand that manytimes, AI is the only option to get your programming project up and going. Nobody wants to spend 4 days debugging a single missing dash. This is why I will use opensource AI models such as Google Gemma, Deepseek R1, Qwen and Llama. The javascript part is pretty easy to understand, as a static website doesn't need any scripts to work. YOU don't deserve, popups, ads and bloat.</p>
