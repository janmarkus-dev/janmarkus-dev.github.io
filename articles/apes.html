<h3 id="key-terms-definitions">Key Terms &amp; Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Community ecology</strong> - The study of interactions among
species</p>
<p><strong>Symbiosis</strong> - Two species living in a close and
long-term association with one another in an ecosystem</p>
<p><strong>Competition</strong> - The struggle of individuals, either
within or between species, to obtain a shared limiting resource</p>
<p><strong>Competitive exclusion principle</strong> - The principle
stating that two species competing for the same limiting resource cannot
coexist</p>
<p><strong>Resource partitioning</strong> - When two species evolve to
divide a resource based on differences in their behavior or
morphology</p>
<p><strong>Predation</strong> - An interaction in which one animal
typically kills and consumes another animal</p>
<p><strong>Parasitoids</strong> - A specialized type of predator that
lays eggs inside other organisms (the host)</p>
<p><strong>Herbivory</strong> - An interaction in which an animal
consumes plants or algae</p>
<p><strong>Mutualism</strong> - An interaction between two species that
increases the chances of survival or reproduction for both species</p>
<p><strong>Photosynthesis</strong> - The process by which plants and
algae use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O)
into glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) and oxygen (O₂)</p>
<p><strong>Commensalism</strong> - An interaction between two species in
which one species benefits and the other species is neither harmed nor
helped</p>
<p><strong>Native species</strong> - A species that lives in its
historical range, typically where it has lived for thousands or millions
of years</p>
<p><strong>Exotic species</strong> - A species living outside its
historical range</p>
<p><strong>Alien species</strong> - Alternative term for exotic
species</p>
<h3 id="resource-partitioning">Resource Partitioning</h3>
<p><strong>Why it occurs:</strong> Resource partitioning occurs because
of the competitive exclusion principle. When two species compete for the
same limiting resource, natural selection favors individuals that
overlap less with the other species in resource use. This reduces
competition between the species.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to species:</strong> Over many generations,
competing species evolve to reduce their overlap in resource use through
three main methods:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Temporal partitioning</strong> - Using the same resource
at different times (e.g., wolves and coyotes hunting at different times
of day)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spatial partitioning</strong> - Using different habitats
(e.g., desert plants with different root depths)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Morphological partitioning</strong> - Evolving different
body sizes or shapes (e.g., Galápagos finches with different beak shapes
for different foods)</p></li>

<p><strong>Ecological Tolerance (Fundamental Niche)</strong>: The range
of abiotic conditions where a species can survive, grow, and
reproduce.</p>
<p><strong>Realized Niche</strong>: The actual conditions where a
species lives after biotic interactions (competition, predation,
disease) further limit its distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic Range</strong>: Areas of the world where a species
actually lives.</p>
<p><strong>Mass Extinction</strong>: Large numbers of species going
extinct over short time periods due to major environmental changes.</p>
<h3 id="factors-affecting-ecological-tolerance">2. Factors Affecting
Ecological Tolerance</h3>
<h4 id="abiotic-factors">Abiotic Factors</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature, humidity, salinity, sunlight, water
flow</strong>: Each species has optimal ranges; extremes prevent
survival or reproduction</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="biotic-factors">Biotic Factors</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competition</strong>: Other species outcompete for
resources</li>
<li><strong>Predation</strong>: Predators prevent establishment in
suitable habitats<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Disease</strong>: Pathogens make environments
uninhabitable</li>
<li><strong>Human barriers</strong>: Roads, dams fragment habitats and
prevent migration</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mass-extinctions-and-ecological-tolerance">3. Mass Extinctions
and Ecological Tolerance</h3>
<p>Five historical mass extinctions occurred when environmental changes
exceeded species’ tolerance limits: - <strong>251 million years
ago</strong>: 90% marine species extinct from unknown environmental
changes - <strong>65 million years ago</strong>: Meteorite impact
blocked sunlight, halting photosynthesis</p>
<h4 id="current-sixth-mass-extinction">Current Sixth Mass
Extinction</h4>
<p>Human activities push species beyond tolerance through: -
<strong>Rapid climate change</strong>: Faster than species can adapt or
migrate - <strong>Habitat destruction</strong>: Eliminates suitable
environments - <strong>New stressors</strong>: Invasive species,
pollution, disease</p>
<p>Species go extinct when: 1. No suitable habitat remains within
tolerance range 2. Physical barriers prevent migration 3. Better
competitors occupy new habitats 4. Changes occur too rapidly for
adaptation</p>
<h2 id="topic-2.5---natural-disruptions-to-ecosystems">Topic 2.5 -
Natural Disruptions to Ecosystems</h2>
<h3 id="key-term-definitions">1. Key Term Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Periodic disruptions</strong> - Regular, predictable
disruptions like day/night cycles or tidal cycles.</p>
<p><strong>Episodic disruptions</strong> - Somewhat regular disruptions
like rain/drought cycles every 5-10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Random disruptions</strong> - Unpredictable disruptions like
volcanic eruptions or hurricanes.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance</strong> - How much a disruption can affect
ecosystem energy and matter flows. High resistance means the ecosystem
maintains function despite disturbance.</p>
<p><strong>Resilience</strong> - The rate an ecosystem returns to its
original state after disruption. High resilience means quick
recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate disturbance hypothesis</strong> - Ecosystems
with intermediate disturbance levels have higher species diversity than
those with very high or low disturbance.</p>
<h3 id="intermediate-disturbance-and-species-diversity">2. Intermediate
Disturbance and Species Diversity</h3>
<p>The hypothesis works because: - <strong>Low disturbance</strong>:
Competitive species dominate and outcompete others - <strong>High
disturbance</strong>: Only fast-reproducing, hardy species survive -
<strong>Intermediate disturbance</strong>: Balance allows both
competitive and resilient species to coexist</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: New England marine algae with periwinkle
snails. Few snails = competitive algae dominate. Many snails = only
unpalatable algae survive. Intermediate snail density = 12 algae species
coexist.</p>
<h3 id="sea-level-changes">3. Sea Level Changes</h3>
<p><strong>Causes</strong>: Ice ages trap water in ice sheets (lowering
levels), warming periods melt ice (raising levels). Driven by Earth’s
orbital changes.</p>
<p><strong>Impacts</strong>: During last Ice Age, levels dropped 120+
meters. After warming, rose 85+ meters. Coastal areas repeatedly
switched between land and marine ecosystems.</p>
<h3 id="animal-migration">4. Animal Migration</h3>
<p><strong>Why</strong>: Animals follow seasonal food availability and
suitable habitats.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Serengeti migration - millions of
wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles migrate in circular patterns following
seasonal rains. They move to areas where rains create fresh vegetation,
returning when original areas recover.</p>

<h3 id="why-tfr-is-lower-in-developed-countries">3. Why TFR is Lower in
Developed Countries</h3>
<p>TFR is typically lower in developed countries for several reasons.
Women tend to delay having their first child due to pursuing education
and employment opportunities, which reduces their childbearing years.
Higher income levels correlate inversely with TFR. Additionally,
developed countries provide better access to family planning services
and birth control information, allowing women greater control over
reproduction.</p>
<h3 id="replacement-level-fertility-rates">4. Replacement-Level
Fertility Rates</h3>
<p><strong>Declining population</strong>: TFR below replacement
level</p>
<p><strong>No growth (stable) population</strong>: TFR at replacement
level</p>
<p><strong>Growing population</strong>: TFR above replacement level</p>
<p><strong>Calculation of replacement-level fertility for a no-growth
country:</strong></p>
<p>In developed countries, replacement-level fertility is typically
about two children per woman plus a small amount extra. This calculation
is based on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two children replace two parents</strong> in theory</li>
<li><strong>Additional amount accounts for:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Small percentage of children who die before reaching reproductive
age</li>
<li>Some individuals who cannot or choose not to have children</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In developing countries, replacement-level fertility is higher
because infant and child mortality rates are higher, meaning more births
are needed to ensure enough individuals survive to reproductive age to
maintain the population.</p>
<p>The key assumption is that there is <strong>no net migration</strong>
(immigration equals emigration). If net migration is positive, a country
can maintain or grow its population even with a TFR below replacement
level.</p>

<p><strong>Albedo</strong>: Percentage of incoming sunlight reflected
from a surface. Snow/ice (80-95%) vs. forests (10-20%).</p>
<p><strong>Saturation Point</strong>: Maximum water vapor air can hold
at a given temperature. When temperature drops, water condenses →
precipitation.</p>
<p><strong>Hadley Cells</strong>: Convection currents between equator
and 30°N/30°S. Warm air rises at equator → precipitation. Cool, dry air
sinks at 30° → deserts.</p>
<p><strong>Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)</strong>: Latitude with
most intense sunlight where Hadley cells converge. Shifts 23.5°N to
23.5°S yearly, creating tropical wet/dry seasons.</p>
<p><strong>Polar Cells</strong>: Air rises at 60°N/60°S (precipitation),
sinks at poles (90°N/90°S), returns to 60°.</p>
<p><strong>Ferrell Cells</strong>: Convection currents between 30° and
60° latitudes. Driven by Hadley and polar cells. Creates variable
mid-latitude winds.</p>
<p><strong>Coriolis Effect</strong>: Deflection of moving objects due to
Earth’s rotation. Creates prevailing wind patterns by deflecting air
currents east or west.</p>

<h3 id="key-term-definition">1. Key Term Definition</h3>
<p><strong>Watershed</strong>: All the land in an area that drains into
a particular stream, river, lake, or wetland.</p>
<h3 id="characteristics-of-a-watershed">2. Characteristics of a
Watershed</h3>
<h4 id="a.-area">A. Area</h4>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The total land surface that drains
water into the watershed’s outlet (can range from a few hectares to
thousands).</p>
<p><strong>Effect on Water Amount</strong>: 1. Larger areas collect more
total precipitation 2. More water is channeled to the outlet 3. Example:
Mississippi River drains nearly one-third of the U.S.</p>
<h4 id="b.-length">B. Length</h4>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Distance along the main water flow from
beginning to outlet.</p>
<p><strong>Effect on Water Amount</strong>: 1. Greater length increases
travel time to outlet 2. Affects timing and concentration of water flow
3. Works with area to determine total water volume</p>
<h4 id="c.-slope">C. Slope</h4>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: The steepness of land within the
watershed.</p>
<p><strong>Effect on Water Amount</strong>: 1. Gentle slopes: water
moves slowly, more infiltration, less runoff, minimal erosion 2. Steep
slopes: water moves fast, less infiltration, more runoff, substantial
erosion and sediment</p>
<h4 id="d.-soil-type">D. Soil Type</h4>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Composition of soil particles (sand,
silt, clay).</p>
<p><strong>Effect on Water Amount</strong>: 1. Sandy soils: highly
permeable, water infiltrates rapidly, less surface runoff 2. Clay soils:
less permeable, more surface runoff, carries sediment easily</p>
<h4 id="e.-vegetation-type">E. Vegetation Type</h4>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Plants and root systems present in the
watershed.</p>
<p><strong>Effect on Water Amount</strong>: 1. With vegetation: roots
hold soil, increase infiltration, reduce runoff, absorb nutrients 2.
Without vegetation: increased erosion, more runoff, more sediment
loss</p>
