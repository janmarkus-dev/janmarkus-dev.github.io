<h3>Prepairing the land</h3>
<p>I would remove cut all of the trees and remove all of the plants by mixing them with the top soil, which, once it decomposes, will provide a nutrition boost. This will require renting Tilling machinery for about 2 hours. This will cost about 150$. The wood will be processed by a team of unskilled workers in about a day, requiring heavy machinery with a price of about 250$. The trunk will be sold to a wood processing utility, earning about 2500$. The branches will be used to build a simple fence to protect the farm from pests which could damage the crop.</p>
<h3>Infrastructure</h3>
<p>A small distributor and processing hut was built with a well on the edge taking about 0.05 acres and costing about 8000$. A drip watering system was installed using DIY tools on all of the 1.95acres of land. The price was about 2000$. 0.95 milion corms (seedling) were purchased and planted costing about 593,750$.</p>

<h3>Scenario 1</h3>
<p>#1 - The main issue would be environmental catastrophies, criminal activity and plant disease. I would need to add nitrogen to the soil using fertilizer or nitrogen-fixating bacteria (yearly about 2000$). The total profits are about 750000$ annually, the profit covers innitial investment, and makes upgrades and improvements possible for the next season.</p>
<p>#2 - Planting a monoculture could lead to habitat loss and using water from the stream could affect it's downstream.</p>
<p>#3 - The drying process could be improved or automated, leading to better yields and higher quality produce.</p>
<h3>Scenario 2, La Nina year</h3>
<p>#1 - It would be profitable, however, it would eat into that years profits</p>
<p>#2 - The processing hut could be damaged, leaking dangerous items into the environment</p>
<p>#3 - Investing into some water management tools could help protect me. Also I can get really good insurance. The costs range from free with some ideas to 4000 usd for more complex solutions.</p>
<h3>Scenario 3</h3>
<p>#1 - I would purchase pesticides specifically meant for these pests and install nets around my plants. The total cost would be about 3000$.</p>
<p>#2 - The pests are not endangered, so their removal is not detrimental, however, my pesticides may affect other species living around my farm.</p>
<p>#3 - Installing the net in #1, which should be relatively cheap, costing about 1500$</p>
